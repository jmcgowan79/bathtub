Installation Instructions for Bathtub Mechanism Simulation Code

Author/Point of Contact: John F. McGowan, Ph.D. (jmcgowan79@gmail.com)

1.  Need to install smoldyn from http://www.smoldyn.org
       o Need to install CMake build system to build smoldyn from sources
       o On Mac, can use MacPorts (sudo port install xxx) to install dependencies
       o  -- may need to install tiff, and freeglut
       o       sudo port install tiff
       o       sudo port install freeglut

2.  Then run:

bash$ make  # to run the simulations

or you can run each simulation manually yourself:

bash$ smoldyn smoldyn_script.txt

to run the simulation.


3.  Use ffmpeg to convert image sequence to a video/movie file
     o  bash$  ffmpeg -i filestem%06d.tif filestem.mp4

4.  Can use vlc video player to view the mp4 files if native video player (e.g. QuickTime) does not work.

5.  To run the Octave *.m scripts, need to download and install Octave (a free numerical program that is mostly compatible with MATLAB) from http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

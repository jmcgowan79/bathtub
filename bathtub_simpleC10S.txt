# DECLARE MOLECULAR SPECIES FOR MODEL

# precursor is harmless (prodrug)
# buffer limits concentration of precursor
# source is the source feature such as telomere
# sourceC is the intermediate bound state of precursor and source
# needs to be long lived relative to diffusion to throttle the reaction

# cell_killer is the active cell killer (at high concentration kills cells that divide?)

# drain is the drain feature such as ... proteosome?  artificially added feature?
# drainC is the intermediate bound state of cell_killer and the drain

# neutral is harmless -- digested rapidly (does not kill dividing cells)
